## Functions
### Lifecycle Functions
#### `setupPlayer(options)`
Initializes the player with the specified options. These options do not apply to all platforms, see chart below.

These options are different than the ones set using `updateOptions()`. Options other than those listed below will not be applied.

You should always call this function (even without any options set) before using the player to make sure everything is initialized.

If the player is already initialized, the promise will resolve instantly.

**Returns:** `Promise`

Register the playback service. The service will run as long as the player runs.

This function should only be called once, and should be registered right after registering your React application with `AppRegistry`.

You should use the playback service to register the event handlers that must be directly tied to the player, as the playback service might keep running when the app is in background.

#### `addEventListener(event, listener)`

| Param    | Type     | Description   |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- |
| event    | `string` | The event name |
| listener | `function(data)` | The listener function |

#### `registerEventHandler(handler)`
**DEPRECATED**: Use registerPlaybackService and addEventListener instead.

Registers an event handler. This function should only be called once, and should be registered right after registering your React application with `AppRegistry`.

| Param   | Type     | Description   |
| ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| handler | `function` | The function that acts as an event handler |

### Resource Object
Resource objects are the result of `require`/`import` for files.

For more information about Resource Objects, read the [Images](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html) section of the React Native documentation

## React Hooks

React v16.8 introduced [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). If you are using a version of React Native that is before [v0.59.0](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/03/12/releasing-react-native-059), your React Native version does not support hooks. 

#### `useTrackPlayerEvents`
Register an event listener for one or more of the [events](#events) emitted by the TrackPlayer. The subscription is removed when the component unmounts.

Check out the [events section](#events) for a full list of supported events.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { useTrackPlayerEvent, TrackPlayerEvents, STATE_PLAYING } from 'react-native-track-player';

// Subscribing to the following events inside MyComponent
const events = [
  TrackPlayerEvents.PLAYBACK_STATE,
  TrackPlayerEvents.PLAYBACK_ERROR
];

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [playerState, setState] = useState(null)

  useTrackPlayerEvents(events, (event) => {
    if (event.type === TrackPlayerEvents.PLAYBACK_ERROR) {
      console.warn('An error occurred while playing the current track.');
    }
    if (event.type === TrackPlayerEvents.PLAYBACK_STATE) {
      setState(playbackState)
    }
  });

  const isPlaying = playerState === STATE_PLAYING;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>The TrackPlayer is {isPlaying ? 'playing' : 'not playing'}</Text>
    </View>
  ); 
};
```

#### `useTrackPlayerProgress`
A hook alternative to the [Progress Component](#progresscomponent).

| State            | Type     | Description                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| position         | `number` | The current position in seconds  |
| bufferedPosition | `number` | The buffered position in seconds |
| duration         | `number` | The duration in seconds          |

`useTrackPlayerProgress` accepts an interval to set the rate (in miliseconds) to poll the track player's progress. The default value is `1000` or every second.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { useTrackPlayerProgress } from 'react-native-track-player';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { position, bufferedPosition, duration } = useTrackPlayerProgress()

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Track progress: {position} seconds out of {duration} total</Text>
      <Text>Buffered progress: {bufferedPosition} seconds buffered out of {duration} total</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```
